        "question": "What is the purpose of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) models?",
        "answer": "The purpose of Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) models is to predict the metabolic behavior of an organism by quantifying the flow of metabolites through its metabolic network. FBA models are used to study and understand cellular metabolism, particularly in the context of predicting the growth rate or biomass yield of an organism under different conditions. By accounting for the stoichiometry of reactions and the constraints imposed by the availability of nutrients, FBA models can simulate the distribution of fluxes through metabolic pathways and identify optimal metabolic states that maximize the production of desired metabolites or biomass. FBA models are valuable tools in systems biology and can be used to guide metabolic engineering efforts, optimize bioprocesses, and explore the metabolic capabilities of organisms."

        "question": "What file formats can be used to upload FBA models into KBase?",
        "answer": "Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) models can be uploaded into KBase using three different file formats. These formats include:\n\n1. Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML): FBA models can be uploaded as SBML files with either the .sbml or .xml file extension. SBML is a standard format for representing computational models in systems biology.\n\n2. Excel: FBA models can also be uploaded as Excel files with the .xls extension. This allows users to create and edit FBA models using spreadsheet software.\n\n3. Tab-separated values (TSV): FBA models can be uploaded as TSV files with the .tsv extension. When using the TSV format, there will be two separate files corresponding to chemical compounds and reactions.\n\nIt is important to note that when uploading an FBA model in the TSV format, the model should be formatted correctly with the appropriate columns and data.\n\nIn summary, FBA models can be uploaded into KBase using SBML, Excel, or TSV file formats, providing users with flexibility in creating and importing their models."
